#### Learn about IPython Notebook

* Make sure to show keyboard shortcuts

#### Exercise

Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?

### Assignment

### Assignment

Write a program that asks the user for one or more sentences and then lets the user know if it is a palindrome. Output what your program is doing at each step. Your program should be made up of functions.

## Day 3
